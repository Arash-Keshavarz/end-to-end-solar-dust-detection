# end-to-end-solar-dust-detection

## Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for solar dust detection. It includes data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

"I built an MLOps pipeline for predictive maintenance of solar farms. The system identifies panels losing efficiency due to dust and automatically schedules cleaning crews, optimizing energy output by X%."
